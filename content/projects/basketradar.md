#### Overview

BasketRadar was developed for customizable, interactive NBA shot mapping and visualization. This product processed spatial shot data and built a "shooting personality" profile for each player, also ranking other players by similarity to the selected player. Data processing and transformation scripts were dispatchable via GitHub workflows with SQLite output sent to Azure Blob Storage. The frontend was built in Plotly Dash and deployed on Azure App Service.
