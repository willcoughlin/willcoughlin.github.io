## Predicting Power Grid Abnormalities

![](/images/GridAbnorm.png)

[Project Repository](https://github.com/willcoughlin/dmsl-project) | [Report (PDF)](/ISYE7406-Group50-ProjectReport.pdf)

This project for Georgia Tech's Data Mining course involved the prediction of abnormal grid conditon occurrences using public archive data from ISO-NE. I trained and evaluated several binary classification models, producing an XGBoost model and a Support Vector Machine model that perform reasonably well in predicting these occurrences. 

This project encompasses a front-to-back data mining project, including

1. Web Scraping
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation

OptionAlly was a simple profit/loss calculator for stock options. The calculator supported a multitude of strategies to support the user's goals and experience level. After selecting an underlying stock and configuring the option strategy, the user could make decisions based on calculated risk and reward of his or her prospective trade.

This is a comprehensive project where I learned how to create React Native apps with Expo and to develop a GraphQL APIs with Apollo Server. The GraphQL Server ran in a simple Docker Container hosted on Amazon ECS.
