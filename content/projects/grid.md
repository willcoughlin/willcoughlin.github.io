This project for Georgia Tech's Data Mining course involved the prediction of abnormal grid conditon occurrences using public archive data from ISO-NE. I trained and evaluated several binary classification models, producing an XGBoost model and a Support Vector Machine model that perform reasonably well in predicting these occurrences. 

This project encompasses a front-to-back data mining project, including

1. Web Scraping
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
